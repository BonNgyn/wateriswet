		<ul>
			<li>
				Goal of the game: To collect as many yellow supply boxes as possible,
				and well of course avoid those sneaky red triangles.
			</li>
			<li>
				1. The main character of the game is Bloo, well um the blue circle ,
				you control Bloo with the four arrow keys.
			<li>
			</li>
				2. When the game starts out you will have a limited amount of steps
				and each time you press one of the arrow keys to move Bloo your step counter
				will decrease by one. To regain the steps you need to navigate to the closests yellow supply box.
			<li>
			</li>
				3. The supply box increases the step counter by 20 and increases your collected
				supplies by 1, so we recommend you collect as many as you can to achieve a high score.
				<li>
			</li>
				4. Of course we wouldn't make a game so easy, so we implemented red triangles
				that want to mob you, if Bloo touches one of the triangles he will be mobbed and somehow still have his supplies left.
			<li>
			</li>
				5. Once the game is over it will display your score(supplies collected) and
				the game will ask you to input your name so you can correctly placed in the high score page.</br>
			</li>
			<li>
				6. Have Fun and Thanks for Playing!</br>
