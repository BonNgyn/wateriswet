				Hey, I’m Irwin Dominguez I’m from a really small town in Oklahoma like it’s just like hills and cows, everywhere. I’m going to be attending the University of Oklahoma in the Fall and I will be majoring in CS.  I like to consider myself as a chill person cause well I think I am. Most of the things that I really enjoy doing are watching movies with friends, listening to music (like Ariana Grande or Ariana Grande). I really hope that you enjoy this game that Team WaterisWet created and that you keep coming back. Thanks For Playing!

					 Hey, I’m Lilly Liu and I currently live in Los Angeles, California. I will be attending Harvey Mudd College in the fall and I plan to major in Computer Science. I have been playing flute for while and I hope to continue to learn music in the future.I love to go out and enjoy nature but also staying at home with food and Netflix. I am really excited that Team Water is Wet actually accomplished making a game in four days (with some bugs) so I hope you enjoy it!

					Hi peeps! My name is Bonnie Nguyen and was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I recently graduated from Cleveland High School and will be attending The University of Washington in Seattle this upcoming fall. I plan to major in computer science and engineering. My hobbies include hiking, biking, listening to music, yelping, playing games, and having fun! And that’s exactly what our game is for, to have fun! So I hope you enjoyed our first web game after only two weeks of lessons.
